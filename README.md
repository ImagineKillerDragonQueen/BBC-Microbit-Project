# BBC-Microbit-Project

For our project, we combined three existing pieces of code from [this](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/introduction.html) website. The three pieces of code we used from this website included code to make our microbit [play music](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/music.html#wolfgang-amadeus-microbit), [detect gestures](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/gestures.html#magic-8) and [speak](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/speech.html).

Our final program is a sort of game. The microbit starts off by displaying a question mark. When the microbit is shaken, it randomly selects one of four characters from the classic video game *Super Mario Bros*. The character's name scrolls across the screen, then the microbit intoduces itself as the character (speaking in a modified voice to suit the character). After this, the microbit plays the chorus of the video game's theme song. The process is now completed, meaning that the microbit will display the question mark once more, ready for the next round of the game.
